            <h3>Welcome to Florence, Italy!</h3>
            <p>Florence was founded as a Roman military colony about the 1st century bce, and during its long history it has been a republic, a seat of the duchy of Tuscany, and a capital (1865–70) of Italy. During the 14th–16th century Florence achieved preeminence in commerce and finance, learning, and especially the arts. Fun fact: The piano was invented in Florence!</p>
            <p>More than 15 million visitors explore Florence each year, and many have migrated to either pursue a career or a more affordable education option than in the US.</p>
            <p>If you are curious about how to move there and the logistics, let me introduce to an option. Have you thought about going to college, but it is afraid of creating more debt?! Well, universities in Italy is cheaper than the United States. Do you already have a degree, but would like to take an opportunity to live in another country and don't know?! You can get a student visa and learn Italian in Florence!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>University Costs</h2>
            <p>If you live in the United States, you know it can be overwhelming to figure out how to pay for college without going into debt for the rest of your life. However, I'm going to shown you that you can get a degree without needing to break your bank; and learn about another culture by living and going to college in a complete different country - and it would be cheaper than 1 year tuition in the US.</p>
            <p>A Bachelor degree in Italy takes 3 years to complete, instead of 4. Their tuition is affordable, even if you are an international student.</p>
            <p>For comparison, let's see the difference between a tuition in Fresno State vs the University of Florence:</p>
            <p id="size"><b>Fresno State:</b> $6,589.00 per semester vs. <b>University of Florence:</b> $1,730 per semester.</p>
            <p>So, if you go to Fresno State for 4 years, you would spend a total of $26,356.00, while if you went to University of Florence as an international student, you would pay in 3 years $5,190.00 (less than the cost of one year!!).</p>
            <p>Fun fact: the University of Florence offers classes in English.</p>
            <p>Another thing to consider is living expenses, let's breakdown that one.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Living Expenses</h2>
            <p>Rent can be expensive, especially in a big/main city. However, the cost of living in Florence, Italy is still pretty affordable.</p>
            <p>For example, this <a href="https://housinganywhere.com/room/1681752/it/Florence/via-dei-banchi" target="_blank">apartment</a> is $946.85 (EUR 800.00), excluding bills, but it comes completely furnished.</p>
            <p>The next question would be "How can I pay for rent and necessities?"</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Job Opportunities</h2>
            <p>If you are an international student, you are allowed to work part-time and up to 20 hours a week, however, most places would require you to know the language.</p>
            <p>But you might now know is there are options to work online, and a great opportunity is to teach English to kids online.</p>
            <p>Most companies require a Bachelor degree (of any type), however <a href="https://t.mmears.com/v2/learn" target="_blank">Magic Ears</a> requires that you are at least working towards a Bachelor degree. And, you can get paid up to $26/hour, and make your own time!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>You can get your Bachelor degree from a reputable university, while exploring a new country, for less money than what would cost you to attend in the United States.</p>
            <p>If traveling is one of your passions and education is important to you, why not join both?! Florence, Italy may as well be a great place to start your adventures! And you can visit the neighboring countries on the weekend!</p>
